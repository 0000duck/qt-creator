    \title External Tool Specification Files

    \section1 Description

    File that describes a tool that can be run from the \gui { Tools > External } menu.
    It specifies the name, the binary to run, what parameters the binary should get
    and what should happen with the tool's output.

    \section1 File Name

    \c {<yourtoolname>.xml}

    \section1 Location

    User specific tools are located in \c {$HOME/.config/Nokia/qtcreator/externaltools}
    on Mac and Linux, and in \c {%APPDATA%\Nokia\qtcreator\externaltools} on Windows.

    System wide tools are located in \c {<Qt Creator install>/share/qtcreator/externaltools}
    on Windows and Linux, and in \c {Qt Creator.app/Contents/Resources/externaltools} on Mac.

    \section1 File Format

    External tool specifications are XML files with the following structure.

    \section2 Main Tag

    The root tag is \c externaltool. It has a mandatory attribute \c id.

    \table
    \header
        \o Tag
        \o Meaning
    \row
        \o externaltool
        \o Root element in a external tool's xml file.
    \endtable
    \table
    \header
        \o Attribute
        \o Meaning
    \row
        \o id
        \o This is a string that is used as an identifier for the external tool.
           There can be no two tools with the same id. Required.
    \endtable

    \section2 Description Tags

    It is mandatory that you give your tool a description, display name and category.
    All three can optionally be translated into different languages by adding multiple
    \c description, \c displayname and \c category tags with different language attributes.

    \table
    \header
        \o Tag
        \o Meaning
    \row
        \o description
        \o Short, one-line description of what the tool is for. Required.
    \row
        \o displayname
        \o Name to show in the menu item for the tool. Required.
    \row
        \o category
        \o Name of the category to show the tool in.
           This is the name of the sub menu under the \c { Tools > External } menu which
           will contain this tool. E.g. a value of \c "Text" for the category will
           put the tool's menu item in the \c { Tools > External > Text } menu. Required.
    \endtable
    \table
    \header
        \o Attribute
        \o Meaning
    \row
        \o xml:lang
        \o Language code (e.g. \c "en" or \c "de") of the lanugage that is used for
           the description, display name, or category. Optional.
    \endtable

    \section2 Executable Specification Tag

    It is mandatory to add a \c executable tag under the root tag, that specifies what to run,
    the parameters given to the process, and what to do with the output.

    \table
    \header
        \o Tag
        \o Meaning
    \row
        \o executable
        \o Encloses subtags that specify what to run and which parameters to use. Required.
    \endtable
    \table
    \header
        \o Attribute
        \o Meaning
    \row
        \o output
        \o Specifies what to do with the tool's standard output stream.
           See \l{Output Behavior Flags} below. Defaults to \c ShowInPane. Optional.
    \row
        \o error
        \o Specifies what to do with the tool's standard error stream.
           See \l{Output Behavior Flags} below. Defaults to \c ShowInPane. Optional.
    \row
        \o modifiesdocument
        \o Spefifies if Qt Creator should expect a change of the current document.
           If this flag is set, Qt Creator asks for saving the current document
           before running the tool (if the current document was modified),
           and silently reloads the current document after the tool has finished.
           \c "yes" or \c "no" (defaults to \c "no"). Optional.
    \endtable

    The \c executable tag allows the following subtags, it is only required to specify at least
    one \c path. All subtags can contain special \l{Qt Creator Variables}.

    \table
    \header
        \o Subtag
        \o Meaning
    \row
        \o path
        \o File path to the executable to run, including the executable's file name.
           If only the executable name is given without a path, it is looked for in the
           system's PATH environment variable. Can be specified multiple times,
           Qt Creator then tries to resolve them in the given order and runs the first
           one that is found. Required.
    \row
        \o arguments
        \o Command line arguments for the executable. This string is in the form
           (with respect to e.g. quoting and argument splitting) how it would
           be specified on the command line of the platform the tool runs on. Optional.
    \row
        \o workingdirectory
        \o The working directory that should be set for the executable. Optional.
    \row
        \o input
        \o A potentially multiline string that is passed to the tool via standard input stream.
    \endtable

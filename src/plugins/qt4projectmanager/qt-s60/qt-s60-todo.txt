* SDK overview page:
    * When the refresh button is pressed
      the qtoptionspage is not updated to reflect the new versions
      though we update them in S60Manager
    * Qt auto-detection fails if no winscw-udeb Qt libs are installed

* QtVersion:
    * support the different tool chains
    * gui for overriding the default make target if necessary,
      make arguments --> make options
    * more general "debug / release" configuration to be used in toolchain???
    * tool chain instance should move to qt4project again, qt version defines
      the possible tool chains, and possibly the tool chain creation, but not
      the currently used one; we can probably get rid of the project parameter
      of ToolChain::defaultMakeTarget then as well
    * build parser should be defined/created by toolchain, not make step

* WINSCW tool chain:
    * predefined macros
    * system includes

* GCCE tool chain:
    * predefined macros
    * system includes

* Run WINSCW executables
* Deploy gcce executables

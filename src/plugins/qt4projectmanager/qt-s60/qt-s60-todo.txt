* SDK overview page:
    * When the refresh button is pressed
      the qtoptionspage is not updated to reflect the new versions
      though we update them in S60Manager
    * Qt auto-detection fails if no winscw-udeb Qt libs are installed

* QtVersion:
    * gui for overriding the default make target if necessary,
      make arguments --> make options
    * build parser should be defined/created by toolchain, not make step

* Debugging helpers
    * must probably be compiled for different toolchains

* Tool chains
    * Qt4Project::setQtVersion should think about tool chains,
      might be better to remove the magic in toolChainType method
    * should the default make target be defined by the project
      instead of tool chain, or perhaps by the QtVersion dependent on a
      tool chain?

* Run Configurations
    * handling of active run config getting disabled not optimal yet
    * might be better from a user perspective if the run configuration
      defines possible tool chains
    * auto-create run configurations the first time s60 qt is selected.

* Run on device
    * Finish runner when application exits
    * passphrase for signing

* Add compile output parser winscw at least

* WINSCW tool chain:
    * predefined macros

* SDK overview page:
    * When the refresh button is pressed
      the qtoptionspage is not updated to reflect the new versions
      though we update them in S60Manager
    * Qt auto-detection fails if no winscw-udeb Qt libs are installed

* QtVersion:
    * gui for overriding the default make target if necessary,
      make arguments --> make options
    * more general "debug / release" configuration to be used in toolchain???
    * build parser should be defined/created by toolchain, not make step

* Debugging helpers
    * must probably be compiled for different toolchains

* Run Configurations
    * enabled property doesn't update correctly
        * missing signals qtVersionChanged + toolChainChanged
    * handling of active run config getting disabled

* Run on device
    * makesis, signsis and applicationinstaller don't report errors back
      via exit code :-(
    * passphrase for signing

* Add compile output parser winscw at least!

* WINSCW tool chain:
    * predefined macros

The QtCreator 1.1 release contains bug fixes and new features.

A more detailed list of changes follows below. If you want to know
the exact and complete list of changes, you can check out the QtCreator
sources from the public git repository and check the logs, e.g.
git clone git://labs.trolltech.com/qt-creator
git log --pretty=oneline origin/1.0.0..origin/master

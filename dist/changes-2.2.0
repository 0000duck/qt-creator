General
   * Added support for running user defined external tools (Tools->External)

Editing
   * Add new Inkpot color scheme
   * Moved 'Open in External Editor' to Tools->External->Text
   * Add UTF-8 BOM support

Project Support
   * QMake project support should be more robust against syntax errors
   * Treatment of command line arguments of processes started from build
     and run configurations underwent heavy modifications:
     - argument lists use native shell syntax; this affects quoting and
       environment variable expansion most
     - the SOURCEDIR and BUILDDIR environment variables were replaced
       with %{sourceDir} and %{buildDir} macros
     - this affects working directories and executable paths as well

Debugging
   * Reworked global architecture to allow multiple debugging sessions (for
     different projects, combined Qml/C++ debugging, project 'snapshots', ...)
   * Reworked breakpoint handling: new special breakpoint types for "break
     on throw", "break on main", data breakpoints.
   * Introduce combined c++/qml debugging (combined stack, cross-step)
   * Rework per-type and per-item selection of display formats
   * New dumpers for QTextCursor, QTextDocument, __m128, QScriptValue
     QBasicAtomicPointer, bit fields, boost::shared_ptr
   * Improve dumpers for QRegion, QVariant (custom types), QSharedPointer,
     QMultiMap (QTCREATORBUG-3122), QObject, QWeakPointer
   * Make alphabetic structure member sorting optional
   * Make dumpers robust in case of missing debug information
   * Improve python dumper profiling support
   * Improve stepping performance
   * Enable breakpoint setting from a disassembler view, QTCREATORBUG-3667
   * Fix display of shadowed variables.
   * Fix display of data containing quoote characters, QTCREATORBUG-3084
   * Fix display of C style 'typedef struct X { ... } X;
   * Fix stack/break view updates after manual module loading, QTCREATORBUG-3427
   * Fix 'Jump To/Run to' when in instruction-wise mode
   * Several fixed to the "watcher" handling
   * Allow re-running debugger engines, QTCREATORBUG-3073
   * Robust process control after -exec-interrupt errors, QTCREATORBUG-2850
   * Robust detection of Qt-in-namespace builds
   * Handle "live updates" in the memory view
   * Make memory view writable
   * Improve starting debugger session directly from the command line

BinEditor:
   * Visualize data differences after updates
   * Fix selection if cursor is left of anchor
   * Allow copying also if selection is "backwards"
   * Do not draw blinking cursor when there is a selection


Help

QML/JS Support
   * Gui cosmetics in JS debugger: Show stack frame level, only valid
     line numbers in stack view, do not show function code, show dummy
     child entry for empty arrays

FakeVim:
   * Implement Ctrl-N/Ctrl-P
   * Implement 's' in visual block mode
   * Fix Alt-Gr handling on Windows
   * Handle more Ctrl-W + <x> commands

Platform Specific

Mac

Linux (GNOME and KDE)

Windows

Symbian Target
   * Added support for the new on-device debugging agent (CODA)

Maemo Target

Designer

Version control plugins

Wizards
   * Support new keywords %MONTH% and %DAY% for C++ template file

Misc
   * Create infrastructure to setup "soft dependencies" between plugins
   * Add a little tool 'qtpromaker' doing the job of 'qmake -project', but
     much faster to make Qt Creator usable to quickly inspect and navigate
     "alien" codebases a way to easily set up dummy .pro files is needed.
   * Start documenting Qt Creator's coding style guidelines

Additional credits go to:
   * The Inkpot color scheme was based on the Vim color scheme by
     Ciaran McCreesh, adapted for Qt Creator by Jan Kundr√°t and
     subsequently updated by Campbell Barton.
